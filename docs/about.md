**THE 3RD ANNIVERSARY OF KOTIPANCHAKSHARI STHOOPAM
KASI MUMUKSHUBHAVAN- VARANASI**

Dear All,

**“जयांजनॆय“** is the panchakshara mantra we adopt this year with the aims **“LOKA KALYANAM AND VISHWASHANTI”**. 

### How to do this japa yagna

This year it is intended to meditate lord hanuman by praying –

!!blockquote|हनुमान् कल्पवृक्षोमे हनुमान् मम कामधुक् \|<br>
चिन्तामणिश्च हनुमान् को विचारः कुतो भयम्? <br><br>
त्वमस्मिन् कार्यनिर्योगे प्रमाणम् हरिसत्तम \|<br>
हनुमान् यत्नमास्थाय दुःखक्षयकरो भव \|\|!!

!!tag|पराशर संहित!!

Daily with pious mind as many times as we can and at night before going
to bed we have to dedicate our effort to the lotus feet of hanuman saying **“लोकाः स्समस्थाः सुखिनोभवंतु - सर्वं श्रि हनुमदार्पणमस्तु”**.
